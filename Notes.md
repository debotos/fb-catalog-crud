# User Access Token

Ref: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens>

This kind of access token is needed any time the app calls an API to read, modify or write a specific person's Facebook data on their behalf. User access tokens are generally obtained via a login dialog and require a person to permit your app to obtain one.
